## Description

This repository provides demos for [API Reference](https://dev.forge.autodesk.com/en/docs/bim360/v1/reference/http/relationship-service-v2-get-relationships-batch-POST/?sha=10129_16).

## What's Postman?

Postman is a popular tool that provides an easy-to-use interface to send HTTP requests. Postman is able to parse the responses that Forge sends you and save response parameter values to variables. These parameters can then be reused in subsequent requests through these variables. The Postman collections in this repository use this ability to provide pre-populated HTTP requests to help you follow the tutorial workflow with minimal effort. You can also modify the requests and experiment without having to write a single line of code. 

- You can learn how to install and use Postman from [here](https://learning.getpostman.com/docs/postman/launching_postman/installation_and_updates).

- You can download the Postman installer from [here](https://www.getpostman.com/downloads/).


## Setup

1.  **Forge Account**: Learn how to create a Forge Account, activate the subscription and create an app by [this tutorial](http://learnforge.autodesk.io/#/account/). Get Forge _client id_, _client secret_ and  _callback url_. Please register Forge app with the _callback url_ as 

    ```https://www.getpostman.com/oauth2/callback```

2. **BIM 360 Account and project**: must be Account Admin to add the app integration. [Learn about provisioning](https://forge.autodesk.com/blog/bim-360-docs-provisioning-forge-apps). Make a note with the __account name__

3. Ensure **Project Management** module has been activated in BIM 360 project. Make a note with the __project name__ .

4. Ensure some relationships are available with your project. e.g. create some model coordination modelset, create clash issue,create asset (with issue/checklist/attachment) etc. 

5.  Clone this repository or download it. It's recommended to install [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/). To clone it via command line, use the following (**Terminal** on MacOSX/Linux, **Git Shell** on Windows):

    ```git clone https://github.com/xiaodongliang/forge-bim360.relationship.api-postman.collection```

6. Import the collection and environment files to Postman

7. In environment, input _client id_, _client secret_, _hub name_ with __account name__, and _project name_ as __project name__

8. In context menu of collection >> **Edit**, switch to the tab **Authorization**. Click **Get New Access Token**, input the variables as below:

   - Grant Type ``Authorization Code``
   
   - Callback URL  ``https://www.getpostman.com/oauth2/callback``

   - Auth URL  ``https://developer.api.autodesk.com/authentication/v1/authorize``

   - Access Token URL  ``https://developer.api.autodesk.com/authentication/v1/gettoken``

   - Client ID ``{{client_id}}``

   - Client Secret ``{{client_secret}}``

   RFI API requires to work with 3-legged token. This collection takes **[Inheriting auth](https://learning.getpostman.com/docs/postman/sending-api-requests/authorization/#inheriting-auth)** to apply 3-legged token to every endpoint in the collection automatically, which means it does not need to input the token in the header explicitly.

## API Test

1. Assume the steps of **Setup** have been performed. The access token is ready.

2. Play the scripts. Try to change some parameters or body with more scenarios. 

3. With [Postman Runner](https://learning.postman.com/docs/running-collections/intro-to-collection-runs/), these scripts can be chained to perform auto-test. Check **Tests** tab to define your preferred tests.
